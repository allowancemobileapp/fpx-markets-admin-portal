// src/actions/transactionActions.ts
'use server';

// This file is now significantly simpler as direct balance adjustments
// are handled in walletActions.ts, and they create 'ADJUSTMENT' transactions.
// The main purpose of this file, if kept, would be to fetch/filter transactions
// for display, or potentially for actions on those logged adjustments (like adding more notes).

// For now, this file can be minimal or even removed if all transaction viewing logic
// directly uses mockTransactions or a future database service.

// import type { Transaction, TransactionStatus } from '@/lib/types';
// import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';
// import { sendEmail } from '@/services/emailService';

// Mock database state management
// let mockTransactionsDB = (await import('@/lib/mock-data')).mockTransactions;
// const mockWalletsDB = (await import('@/lib/mock-data')).mockWallets;
// const mockUsersDB = (await import('@/lib/mock-data')).mockUsers;


// The processTransaction and addTransactionNote functions are removed
// as the new flow is direct balance adjustment via walletActions.ts.

// If there's a need to, for example, add a subsequent note to an already logged ADJUSTMENT transaction,
// a function could be added here. But for now, notes are part of the initial adjustment.

// Example: Function to get transactions (can be expanded with filters)
// export async function getTransactionsLog(): Promise<Transaction[]> {
//   return [...mockTransactionsDB].sort((a, b) => new Date(b.created_at).getTime() - new Date(a.created_at).getTime());
// }

// No actions are currently exported from this file as per the simplified requirements.
// The TransactionTableClient will directly use mock-data for now.
// If fetching logic becomes complex, it can be added here.
export {}; // Keep file as module
