// This file is no longer used for runtime data as the application now connects
// to a real PostgreSQL database. It can be kept for reference, for seeding scripts,
// or for local development if the database is not available.

// However, for the current functionality, no mock data is actively used by the
// server actions or page data fetching logic.

// Example structure (can be removed or commented out):
/*
import type { User, Transaction, TradingPlan, Wallet, TransactionStatus, CurrencyCode, TransactionType } from './types';

export const mockTradingPlans: TradingPlan[] = [
  // ... example trading plans

export let mockWallets: Wallet[] = [
  // ... example wallets
];

export let mockTransactions: Transaction[] = [
  // ... example transactions
];

// To prevent errors if this file is imported elsewhere expecting exports,
// we can add an empty export or a placeholder.
export {};
